# Call for Papers — EMSE Special Issue for the “International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2024)”

A special issue of the [Empirical Software Engineering Journal](http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/10664).

## Editors of the Special Issue

- Fabio Palomba, (University of Salerno, Italy), fpalomba@unisa.it;
- Ipek Ozkaya, (Carnegie Mellon University, United States), ozkaya@sei.cmu.edu.

## Description of the Special Issue
Software analysis, evolution, and reengineering encompass the theory and practice of recovering information from existing software and systems, the exploration of innovative methods to extract the many kinds of information that can be recovered from software, software engineering documents, and systems artifacts, and the examination of innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding. 

The special issue invites submission on novel and innovative research results and industrial experience papers in the area of software Analysis, evolution, and reengineering. We especially encourage the submission of extended papers from the 31st International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2024).
